# World-Language-Tectonics
A way to imagine Mixed Reality experience through collaborative virtual landmark. Where users will constitute collectively, a digital monument composed with an ongoing accumulation of text inputs, each a personal response to the same open question: “what’s your message to this WORLD?” The collected input will collaboratively formulate a structural archetype of texts, each randomly translated into a different language, and semantically classified by a deep learning language model (GPT-3) to fuse the text within 1 of 4 rings of sentiments. Each orbiting with a distinct color, revolving and gravitating around a central core (a white spherical structure composed with the word "WORLD" written in different languages).
